        <p>
<strong>Password Security</strong> refers to the practice of protecting online accounts
and digital systems by using strong and confidential passwords.
Passwords act as the <strong>first line of defense</strong> against unauthorized access.
A secure password prevents hackers from gaining access to personal and
sensitive information.
Password security also involves keeping passwords private and not sharing them
with others.
In the digital world, weak passwords can easily be guessed or cracked.
Proper password security helps protect email, social media, banking and
other online accounts.
Following password security practices is essential for digital safety.

        <p>
<strong>Strong Passwords</strong> are passwords that are difficult to guess or break.
A strong password usually contains a combination of <strong>uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers and special characters</strong>.
Longer passwords are generally more secure than short ones.
Strong passwords reduce the risk of hacking and brute-force attacks.
Each online account should have a unique password.
Avoid using personal information such as names, dates of birth or phone numbers.
Using strong passwords greatly improves overall online security.
