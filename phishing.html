<strong>Phishing</strong> is a type of cyber attack in which attackers try to trick users
into sharing sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, credit card numbers
or OTPs.
The attacker usually pretends to be a trusted organization, company or person.
Phishing attacks are commonly carried out through <strong>fake emails, messages,
websites or phone calls</strong>.
These messages often create fear or urgency to force users to act quickly.
Once the victim shares information, attackers misuse it for fraud or identity theft.
Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats today.
Being aware of phishing helps users stay alert and avoid online scams.
